# Anatomy of a Modern JavaScript Application ðŸ§ 


## ðŸ’¡ Learning Objectives

You now know JavaScript well enough to write simple and complex frontend applications, and querying an API as well. You know the language, and you know its power, but something is still missing. The code seems convoluted and all over the place. Is this really how established developers work, you may wonder?
At the end of this challenge you will:

* be able to organize your code with multiple functions
* be able to organize your code in multiple files
* be able to use a package manager to import third-party libraries in your code
* be able to use linters and formatters to make your code cleaner and more bug-free
* be able to optimize your code to be shipped to a browser faster

 
## ðŸ‘£ Steps 

1. Refactor - Reorganize (refactor) the code in as many functions

2. JavaScript Modules - Divide code into multiple files for better organization

3. Modules and the Browser - Combining files with a bundler 


## ðŸ”¦ Tools used 

- Javascript
- Webpack
